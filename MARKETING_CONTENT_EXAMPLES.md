# Marketing Content Guide: Showing Off Your Unique Hooks
## Practical Examples You Can Actually Make

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-09

This guide shows you exactly HOW to create posts showcasing your three unique hooks. Copy these templates, adapt them, and use them.

---

## Hook #1: ESENS Notation System

**Why it matters:** It's your MOST unique feature. No other game has this. It's also complex enough to be interesting but simple enough to explain visually.

### Content Idea 1: "Decode This Potion" (Interactive Post)

**Format:** Twitter/Reddit post with quiz element

**What to create:**
```
🧪 Can you decode this potion?

P+S30%3T>A.F

What does it do?

A) Adds 30 strength for 3 turns when you attack
B) Adds 30 speed permanently
C) Deals 30 fire damage over 3 turns
D) Something else?

Reply with your guess! I'll reveal the answer + explain the notation in 2 hours.

#IndieGameDev #GameDesign
```

**Then reply with the breakdown:**
```
✅ Answer: A!

Let me break down the notation:

P = Applies to Player
+ = Positive effect
S = Strength stat
30% = 30% increase
3T = Lasts 3 turns
>A = Triggers when you Attack
.F = Fire element

One line of notation = complex potion behavior!

This is how crafting works in PotionWorld 🧪
```

**Why this works:**
- Interactive (people love quizzes)
- Teaches by engaging
- Shows depth without overwhelming
- Creates conversation in replies

**Time to create:** 10 minutes

---

### Content Idea 2: "Same Effect, Different Approaches" (Visual Comparison)

**Format:** Image post comparing 3 potions

**What to create:** A simple graphic showing:

```
Goal: Heal the player

Approach 1 (Basic):
P+H50.I
→ Instant heal of 50 HP

Approach 2 (Over Time):
P+H10%5T.ST
→ Heal 10 HP per turn for 5 turns (50 total but stackable!)

Approach 3 (Triggered):
P+H80<D.RN
→ Heal 80 HP when damaged (can't be removed)

Which would YOU use in a boss fight?
```

**Visual format:**
- 3 columns
- Each shows the ESENS notation
- Each shows what it does in plain English
- Each has a simple icon (healing potion bottle)

**Tool:** Canva (free), or even just a screenshot of text in a nice font

**Why this works:**
- Shows strategic depth
- Demonstrates player choice
- Easy to understand comparison
- Invites discussion ("I'd use #2!")

**Time to create:** 20 minutes

---

### Content Idea 3: "Building a Combat Combo" (Thread/Video)

**Format:** Twitter thread or short video (30 seconds)

**Thread version:**

```
🧵 Thread: How combos work in PotionWorld

Let's build a devastating 2-potion combo using ESENS notation.

(1/5)

First, we drink this:
P+S50%C>A.ST

Translation: +50% strength for entire combat, triggers on attack, stacks with other potions

We're now a glass cannon.

(2/5)

Problem: We're fragile. We need defense.

So we drink this:
P+D40%C<D.ST

Translation: +40% defense for entire combat, triggers when we're damaged, stacks

Now we're a TANK.

(3/5)

Here's where it gets cool.

We attack → Strength potion triggers (+50% damage!)
Enemy hits back → Defense potion triggers (+40% defense!)

Both effects stack and last the whole fight.

(4/5)

This is emergent gameplay from the notation system.

I didn't script this combo - players discover it by understanding ESENS.

That's the magic. 🪄

(5/5)

Want to see more potion combos? Reply with an emoji and I'll share the "poison DOT chain" next week 😈

#IndieGameDev #PotionWorld
```

**Why this works:**
- Tells a story (problem → solution)
- Shows system depth
- Demonstrates mastery is rewarding
- Creates anticipation (next week's thread)

**Time to create:** 15 minutes

### Content Idea 4: "ESENS Notation Cheat Sheet" (Downloadable)

**Format:** Infographic/image

**What to create:** A one-page visual guide

```
╔════════════════════════════════════╗
║   ESENS NOTATION CHEAT SHEET      ║
╚════════════════════════════════════╝

TARGET
  P = Player    E = Enemy    A = All

EFFECT TYPE
  + = Buff      - = Debuff    ! = Status

STATS
  H = Health    S = Strength    D = Defense
  I = Initiative    R = Resistance

MAGNITUDE
  50 = Flat value    30% = Percentage

DURATION
  3T = 3 Turns    5s = 5 Seconds    C = Combat

TRIGGERS
  >A = On Attack    <D = On Damaged
  ^S = Start of Turn    vE = End of Turn

PROPERTIES
  .ST = Stackable    .RN = Can't Remove
  .F = Fire    .I = Ice    .P = Poison

EXAMPLE:
P+S30%3T>A.F.ST
= Player gains 30% strength for 3 turns when attacking, fire element, stackable

Start crafting! 🧪
```

**Tool:** Canva, Google Slides, or even MS Paint

**Why this works:**
- High value (people save/share useful references)
- Shows you've thought this through
- Positions you as expert
- Gets retweeted/saved

**Time to create:** 30-45 minutes (but reusable forever)

---

## Hook #2: Life Journey Narrative

**Why it matters:** Emotional resonance. Most games are about one adventure. Yours is about a whole LIFE. That's unique and meaningful.

### Content Idea 1: "Ezekiel Across the Seasons" (Character Evolution)

**Format:** Image post with side-by-side comparison

**What to create:** Visual showing Ezekiel at different ages

```
Ezekiel Through the Seasons 🌱➡️🌳

Season 1 (Age 14):
Curious experimenter, gets in trouble at academy
Your choice: Support his innovation or follow the rules?

Season 3 (Age 28):
IF you supported him → Master innovator, credits you as inspiration, ally in tournaments
IF you didn't → Still successful but distant, sees you as "playing it safe"

Season 5 (Age 45+):
IF close → Teaches your apprentices revolutionary techniques
IF distant → Competitor's mentor, respectful but not warm

One choice at age 14. Ripples for 30+ years.

This is PotionWorld.
```

**Visual:** Simple text overlay on background, or stick figures aging up

**Why this works:**
- Shows consequences matter LONG-TERM
- Emotionally powerful (people love "where are they now?")
- Demonstrates your design depth
- Makes people care about characters before game exists

**Time to create:** 20 minutes

---

### Content Idea 2: "The Affinity Timeline" (Visual Graph)

**Format:** Line graph showing relationship evolution

**What to create:** Simple graph showing affinity over time

```
How relationships ACTUALLY work in PotionWorld

[Simple line graph]

Y-axis: Affinity (-5 to +5)
X-axis: Season 1 → Season 5

Ezekiel's affinity line:
- Starts at 0 (neutral)
- Spikes to +2.5 after you support his experiment (Season 1)
- Slowly decays to +1.5 (you don't talk much in Season 2)
- Jumps to +4.0 after you help him in tournament (Season 3)
- Stays high in Season 4-5 (strong memories resist decay)

Relationships require MAINTENANCE, just like real life.

Ignore your friends for a year? Affinity decays.
Big moments? They create lasting memories.

Not just a number - a simulation of real friendship.
```

**Tool:** Excel/Google Sheets → screenshot, or draw in Paint

**Why this works:**
- Shows realistic relationship modeling
- Relatable to real life
- Demonstrates thoughtful design
- Appeals to simulation/system lovers

**Time to create:** 15 minutes

---

### Content Idea 3: "Where Will You Be?" (Player Reflection)

**Format:** Emotional storytelling post

**What to create:**

```
A question for you:

You're 14, learning to make potions at an academy.

Your roommate has nightmares. Do you:
- Ask her about it? (Build trust slowly)
- Give her privacy? (Respect boundaries)
- Brew a sleep aid potion? (Help through action)

You're 25, a struggling shop owner during a plague.

Do you:
- Charge full price for healing potions? (Survive financially)
- Discount for the poor? (Help community, risk bankruptcy)
- Hoard ingredients? (Prepare for shortage)

You're 40, the kingdom's best alchemist.

A student asks you to share your secret techniques. Do you:
- Share freely? (Advance the field)
- Sell the knowledge? (Secure your legacy)
- Keep it secret? (Maintain your edge)

These aren't "right or wrong."

They're "who are you becoming?"

That's PotionWorld - a life's journey in choices.

Which age are you most curious about? 🧪
```

**Why this works:**
- No game footage needed (just questions!)
- Makes people imagine themselves in the story
- Shows moral depth
- Creates discussion in comments
- Emotionally engaging

**Time to create:** 10 minutes

---

### Content Idea 4: "The Potion Book of Life" (Metaphor Post)

**Format:** Philosophical/poetic post

**What to create:**

```
In PotionWorld, your Recipe Book isn't just for potions.

It's a journal of your life.

Season 1 (Age 14):
"Simple Healing Tonic - First successful craft. Instructor Thornwood said 'adequate.' High praise from him."

Season 2 (Age 22):
"Grandmother's Remedy - She taught me this before she passed. I'll never change this recipe."

Season 3 (Age 28):
"Emberforge's Challenge Potion - Created after Kael pushed me to innovate. We've come far from academy rivals."

Season 4 (Age 35):
"Counter-Poison #47 - This one saved the prince. Some recipes save lives, not just HP."

Season 5 (Age 50):
"Legacy Elixir - I'm teaching this to my apprentices. My grandmother would be proud."

Your recipes remember your story.

That's why I'm making this game. 🧪
```

**Why this works:**
- Poetic and emotional
- Shows the meta-narrative (recipes = life memories)
- Doesn't need any game footage
- Positions the game as meaningful, not just fun
- People share emotional posts

**Time to create:** 10 minutes

## Hook #3: Cozy + Meaningful Choices

**Why it matters:** This combination is RARE. Most cozy games have no real choices. Most choice-heavy games are stressful. You're threading the needle.

### Content Idea 1: "No Wrong Answers, Just Different Lives" (Choice Tree)

**Format:** Flowchart/image post

**What to create:**

```
The Ezekiel Dilemma (Season 0 Demo)

Situation: Your classmate was caught experimenting with forbidden ingredients. He might get expelled.

[CHOICE TREE]

Option 1: "Support Him Fully"
→ Ezekiel: +2.5 affinity
→ Unlocks: Innovator trait
→ Season 1: He shares advanced techniques with you
→ Feeling: You stood up for creativity

Option 2: "Offer Diplomatic Solution"
→ Ezekiel: +2.0 affinity
→ Thornwood: +0.5 affinity
→ Unlocks: Diplomat trait
→ Season 1: Both respect you as mediator
→ Feeling: You found the middle path

Option 3: "Stay Neutral"
→ Ezekiel: -0.5 affinity
→ Unlocks: Self-Preserving trait
→ Season 1: He keeps his distance
→ Feeling: You chose safety

Option 4: "Gentle Critique"
→ Ezekiel: +0.5 affinity
→ Thornwood: +0.3 affinity
→ Unlocks: Balanced trait
→ Season 1: He appreciates your honesty
→ Feeling: You were truthful

Notice: All 4 lead to different but valid paths.

This isn't "good ending" vs "bad ending."
It's "who are you?"

That's cozy + meaningful.
```

**Visual:** Simple flowchart with 4 branches

**Why this works:**
- Shows there's no "game over" for making the "wrong" choice
- Demonstrates actual branching
- Appeals to choice-driven players
- Relieves anxiety (cozy aspect)

**Time to create:** 25 minutes

---

### Content Idea 2: "The Comfort of Consequences" (Philosophy Post)

**Format:** Text post/thread

**What to create:**

```
Hot take: Meaningful choices don't have to be stressful.

Here's what STRESSFUL choices look like:
❌ Time limits (decide in 10 seconds!)
❌ Permanent missables (if you don't do X, you fail forever!)
❌ Hidden information (you can't know the outcome!)
❌ Punishing consequences (choose wrong = game over!)

Here's what COZY choices look like:
✅ Take your time (no timer)
✅ Multiple valid paths (not right/wrong)
✅ Transparent outcomes (you see the trade-offs)
✅ Consequences, not punishments (different, not worse)

Example from PotionWorld:

Stressful version:
"Charge the poor villager full price or give discount? [10 seconds to choose] [If wrong, they die and you fail]"

Cozy version:
"Charge full price (keep shop afloat, -1 affinity) or discount (help community, +1 affinity, less gold). Both work. Who do you want to be?"

Same depth. Zero stress.

That's the magic I'm chasing. 🧪

Thoughts?
```

**Why this works:**
- Explains your design philosophy
- Contrasts with stressful games (helpful for non-gamers to understand)
- Shows you've thought deeply about this
- Resonates with cozy game community
- Invites discussion

**Time to create:** 10 minutes

---

### Content Idea 3: "The Affinity Reveal" (Video/GIF)

**Format:** 10-second screen recording or GIF

**What to create:** Record this interaction

```
[Screen recording of dialogue choice]

Ezekiel: "I just... I can't stop wondering. What if I mixed crystals with moonbell petals?"

Your choices:
> "That sounds dangerous."
> "Let's try it together!"
> "What does your research say?"

[Player selects "Let's try it together!"]

[Animation: Ezekiel's portrait smiles]
[UI notification pops up: "Ezekiel +1.5 affinity ❤️"]
[Trait unlocked: "Supportive Friend"]

Ezekiel: "Really? You'd help me? I... thank you. This means everything."

[End screen: "Your choices shape relationships"]
```

**Why this works:**
- SHOWS the system, doesn't just describe it
- Warm and fuzzy (cozy!)
- But shows mechanical depth (affinity numbers)
- 10 seconds = Twitter-friendly, Reddit-friendly

**Time to create:** 15 minutes (once you have the scene built)

---

### Content Idea 4: "Cozy Doesn't Mean Easy" (Misconception Post)

**Format:** Educational post

**What to create:**

```
Misconception: "Cozy games have no challenge"

Reality: Cozy games have different challenges.

Stardew Valley:
❌ No combat? WRONG - there's combat
✅ But the REAL challenge is time management + relationships

Animal Crossing:
❌ No goals? WRONG - tons of goals
✅ But you set the pace, no pressure

PotionWorld:
❌ No choices? WRONG - tons of branching choices
✅ But no "game overs," just different lives

Cozy = Stress-free
Cozy ≠ Mindless

You still have to:
- Manage ingredients (resource management)
- Build relationships (social puzzle)
- Craft quality potions (skill-based minigame)
- Make hard moral choices (ethical dilemmas)

It's just... gentle about it.

Like a warm hug that respects your intelligence. 🧸

Does this make sense? Or am I overthinking? 😅
```

**Why this works:**
- Addresses a common concern ("too easy?")
- Positions your game correctly
- Uses examples people know (SDV, AC)
- Shows you understand your genre
- Humble tone invites engagement

**Time to create:** 10 minutes

## Quick Post Templates (5-Minute Posts)

### Template 1: "Did You Know?" Fact
```
Did you know?

In PotionWorld, NPCs remember EVERYTHING you do.

Help an NPC in Season 1 (age 14)?
They'll reference it in Season 5 (age 50+).

"I still remember when you helped me pass that exam 30 years ago."

That's the power of a life-journey game. 🧪

#IndieGameDev #PotionWorld
```

### Template 2: "Compare & Contrast"
```
Other games: "Choose A or B"

PotionWorld: "Choose A, B, C, or D - all lead to different but valid lives"

Other games: "Here's 50 HP"

PotionWorld: "Here's 50 HP instantly, or 10 HP/turn for 5 turns that stacks, or 80 HP when damaged - you decide"

Other games: Age 20 to 25

PotionWorld: Age 14 to 60+

We're building something different. 🧪
```

### Template 3: "Behind the Design"
```
Design challenge: How do you make relationships feel REAL?

My solution:
- Affinity decays toward neutral if you ignore NPCs
- Big moments create lasting memories that resist decay
- Personality affects how NPCs interpret the SAME action

Result: Friendships require maintenance, just like real life.

Is this too complex? Or just right? 🤔
```

### Template 4: "Progress Update"
```
This week I built:
✅ ESENS parser now handles trigger chains (>A can trigger >Sprd)
✅ Affinity decay system (relationships need maintenance!)
✅ Recipe mastery levels (0-100 per potion)

Next week:
🔲 Crafting minigame prototype
🔲 First NPC dialogue tree
🔲 Memory system for NPCs

Slow and steady. 🐢🧪
```

## The Most Important Tip

**You don't need to CREATE content.**

**You need to SHARE what you're already building.**

- Building the ESENS parser? → Post about it
- Designing Ezekiel's arc? → Share his character evolution
- Struggling with a bug? → Post the problem + solution
- Made a decision about cozy vs challenge? → Share your reasoning

The game IS the content. Just translate it for your audience.

---

## Need Help?

Stuck on what to post this week?

1. Open your GameDesign.md
2. Find one system you're proud of
3. Ask: "How would I explain this to a friend who doesn't make games?"
4. Write that explanation
5. Add one image/GIF
6. Post it

You just created content. ✅

---

**Remember:** You're not a marketer. You're a dev who shares their journey.

That's all you need to be.

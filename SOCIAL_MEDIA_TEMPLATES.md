```
Design question: How should relationships work?

Why? Real friendships require maintenance.

### Template 2: System Deep-Dive (r/GameDesign, r/IndieDev)
```
[Title: "How I'm designing [System Name] in my cozy RPG"]

I'm working on PotionWorld, a cozy potion-crafting RPG. I wanted to share how I'm approaching [system name].

**The Goal:**
[What you want to achieve]

**The Challenge:**
[Why it's hard]

**My Solution:**
[How you solved it]

**Example:**
[Concrete example]

**Why I think this works:**
[Your reasoning]

I'd love feedback! Is this too complex? Not enough? What would you change?

[Visual if you have one]
```

**Example for ESENS:**
```
[Title: "How I'm designing a potion notation system (like music notation, but for alchemy)"]

I'm working on PotionWorld, a cozy potion-crafting RPG. I wanted to share my ESENS notation system.

**The Goal:**
Create a system where players can craft complex potions with emergent effects without overwhelming new players.

**The Challenge:**
"This potion gives +30% strength for 3 turns when you attack" is 10 words. How do you make that readable at a glance?

**My Solution:**
ESENS notation: P+S30%3T>A

P = Player
+ = Buff
S = Strength
30% = Magnitude
3T = Duration (3 turns)
>A = Trigger (on attack)

**Example:**
Players can create combos:
- Potion 1: P+S50%C>A (strength on attack)
- Potion 2: P+D40%C<D (defense when damaged)
- Both stack → powerful synergy

**Why I think this works:**
It's visual, compact, and learnable. Like sheet music - looks complex at first, but becomes second nature.

I'd love feedback! Too nerdy? Just right?

```

**When to use:** Every 2-3 weeks, rotating systems
**Time:** 25 minutes

That's enough.

# Level Definitions

# Each [[levels]] block is one battle.
# First entry's heroes carry forward to later levels unless redefined.
#
# symbols: "TOKEN@COUNT" — grammar cards auto-built into the deck.
#          Omit @COUNT to default to 2 copies.
# implied_cards: "TOKEN@SLOT" — pre-filled, locked cards in slot positions.
# deck_extras: card IDs from cards.toml (action/curse cards added to deck).
# heroes: first character = the one the player protects.
# enemies: opponent(s).

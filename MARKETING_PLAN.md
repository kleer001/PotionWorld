# Marketing Plan for PotionWorld
## Solo Dev, No Budget, Limited Time - Let's Be Real

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-09
**Your Constraints:** Solo parent dev, 10 hrs/week total, $0 marketing budget, don't regularly play games
**Your Advantages:** Unique concept, strong design docs, building something authentic

---

## The Harsh Truth First

**What WON'T work for you:**
- ❌ Paid ads (you have no budget)
- ❌ Going viral on TikTok (requires constant content creation)
- ❌ Game conferences (expensive, time-consuming)
- ❌ PR agencies (expensive)
- ❌ Posting once and hoping for the best

**What WILL work for you:**
- ✅ Building in public (document your journey)
- ✅ Finding your 100 true fans before launch
- ✅ Authentic community engagement (quality over quantity)
- ✅ Starting NOW, not when the game is "ready"
- ✅ Consistency over perfection (1 post/week beats 0)

---

## Your Core Strategy: The Patient Builder

**Philosophy:** You're not trying to reach millions. You're trying to find the 1,000-10,000 people who will LOVE a cozy potion-crafting RPG about life's journey.

**Time Investment:** 1-2 hours per week MAX (10-20% of your dev time)

**Approach:** Document, don't create. Share what you're already doing.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4) - START NOW

### Week 1: Set Up Your Presence

**Time: 2 hours total**

1. **Create a Twitter/X account** (30 min)
   - Handle: @PotionWorldGame or similar
   - Bio: "Cozy potion-crafting RPG about a life's journey from apprentice to master. Solo dev, building in public."
   - Header: Something warm and cozy (can be placeholder)
   - Pin a thread: "What is PotionWorld?" (3-5 tweets explaining the concept)

2. **Create a Dev Log on itch.io** (30 min)
   - Create project page (can be hidden until demo ready)
   - Write first devlog: "Why I'm Making This Game"
   - Share the ESENS system concept
   - No game yet? That's fine. Share the vision.

3. **Join 3 communities** (30 min)
   - r/CozyGamers (Reddit)
   - r/IndieDev (Reddit)
   - Cozy Game Discord servers (search "cozy games discord")

4. **Create a simple presskit** (30 min)
   - One-sentence pitch
   - Three-paragraph description
   - Your contact email
   - Link to devlog
   - Save as `presskit.txt` in your repo

**Deliverable:** You now exist online and can be found.

### Week 2-4: First Posts

**Time: 1 hour per week**

**Post once per week about:**
- Week 2: "Here's the ESENS notation system I'm building" (share the parser, make it visual)
- Week 3: "The Big 5 personality system for NPCs" (share how relationships work)
- Week 4: "Season 0 design goals" (share your 30-min demo plan)

**Format:**
- 1 image (screenshot, diagram, or design doc snippet)
- 3-5 sentences of context
- 1-2 relevant hashtags (#IndieGameDev #CozyGames)
- End with a question to encourage replies

**Example Post:**
> "Working on a relationship system for PotionWorld where NPCs remember your choices across a lifetime. Using the Big 5 personality model - each character reacts differently to the same action.
>
> High Agreeableness NPCs love when you help others. Low Agreeableness NPCs think you're wasting time.
>
> [Screenshot of affinity system or character trait diagram]
>
> Question: Do you prefer games where relationships are simple (good/bad) or complex? #IndieGameDev #CozyGames"

---

## Phase 2: Build In Public (Ongoing)

### Your Weekly Rhythm (1-2 hrs/week)

**Every Monday (or your dev day):**
- Spend 15-30 min documenting what you worked on
- Take 1-2 screenshots or record a 10-second clip
- Write a short post (Twitter thread or devlog)

**Topics to Share (rotate through these):**
- System design (crafting, relationships, progression)
- Behind-the-scenes (your dev setup, time management as a parent)
- Challenges and solutions (bugs you fixed, design problems you solved)
- Milestones (first potion crafted, first NPC dialogue working)
- Lore and worldbuilding (share NPC backstories)
- Failed experiments (what didn't work and why)

**The Formula:**
1. What I worked on this week
2. Why it matters to the game
3. One visual (screenshot, GIF, diagram)
4. A question or call-to-action

---

## Phase 3: Community Building (Months 2-6)

### Find Your People

**Target Communities:**

1. **Cozy Gamers**
   - r/CozyGamers
   - r/StardewValley (inspiration post: "What I learned from SDV")
   - Cozy Game Club Discord
   - Twitter: Search #CozyGames, follow/engage with fans

2. **Crafting Game Fans**
   - r/CraftingGames
   - Potion Craft community (similar mechanics)
   - Twitter: #CraftingGames

3. **Narrative RPG Fans**
   - r/JRPG (for life-journey games like Persona)
   - Fire Emblem community (relationship systems)
   - Twitter: #VisualNovel #NarrativeGames

4. **Solo Devs & Allies**
   - r/IndieDev
   - r/Godot (you're using Godot!)
   - IndieGameDev Twitter community
   - #BuiltWithGodot

**How to Engage (30 min/week):**
- Comment thoughtfully on 5-10 posts related to your game's themes
- Answer questions in communities (build reputation)
- Share others' work you genuinely like
- Don't spam your game - be a community member first

### The 90/10 Rule
- 90% of posts: Helpful, interesting, or entertaining (not about your game)
- 10% of posts: Directly promoting your game

---

## Phase 4: Demo Launch Prep (Month Before Demo)

### 4 Weeks Before Demo Ready

**Week -4: Create Marketing Assets**
- GIF of crafting minigame (10 seconds, satisfying)
- GIF of dialogue choice → consequence (show choice matters)
- 3-5 screenshots (garden, dorm, classroom, Ezekiel choice)
- 1-minute trailer (can be simple screen recording with text overlays)
- Steam page if possible (free to set up, builds wishlist)

**Week -3: Seed Interest**
- Post: "Demo coming in 3 weeks, here's what you'll play"
- Share exactly what's in the 30-60 min demo
- Ask: "What matters most in a demo?" (engagement)

**Week -2: Build Hype**
- Post: "2 weeks until demo! Here's the Ezekiel choice in action" (show consequence system)
- Reach out to 5-10 small indie game YouTubers/streamers
  - Find ones who cover cozy games or demos
  - Under 10k subs (more likely to respond)
  - Email: "Hey, making a cozy potion RPG, demo in 2 weeks, would you be interested?"

**Week -1: Final Push**
- Post daily teasers (screenshot + caption)
- "Demo launches Friday! Here's how to play it"
- Prep itch.io page to go live

### Demo Launch Day

**Have Ready:**
- itch.io page live with demo
- Twitter announcement thread (what/why/where)
- Reddit posts in 3 communities (r/CozyGamers, r/IndieDev, r/Godot)
- Email to the 5-10 streamers you contacted

**Post-Launch (First Week):**
- Monitor feedback CLOSELY
- Respond to every comment/reply
- Fix critical bugs immediately
- Share player reactions (with permission)
- Post: "Here's what players are saying"

---

## Your Marketing Calendar Template

### Monthly (1st of month)
- Update devlog with progress
- Share roadmap update

### Weekly (every Monday)
- 1 Twitter/X post with dev update
- Engage with 5-10 community posts

### When Milestones Happen
- Post immediately with visual proof
- Examples: "First NPC dialogue works!" "Crafting minigame complete!" "Hit 100 wishlists!"

---

## Specific Tactics That Work for Solo Devs

### 1. The "Build In Public" Thread
Start a numbered series on Twitter:
- "Building PotionWorld, Day 1: Parsing ESENS notation"
- "Building PotionWorld, Day 7: First potion crafted!"
- "Building PotionWorld, Day 30: Ezekiel choice is in!"

People love following journeys. Consistency matters more than perfection.

### 2. The "Why I'm Building This" Post
Write authentically about:
- Why this game matters to you
- What inspired it (grandmother's blessing, life journey theme)
- Your constraints (solo parent, limited time)
- Your vision (not trying to be AAA, trying to make something meaningful)

Authenticity resonates. People root for real humans making real things.

### 3. The "System Deep-Dive" Post
Every 2-3 weeks, explain one system in depth:
- ESENS notation with examples
- Big 5 personality system
- Affinity decay and memory system
- How seasons connect

These attract the hardcore fans who will champion your game.

### 4. The "Show, Don't Tell" GIF
- 10-second crafting loop GIF (gather → craft → success)
- NPCs reacting differently to same choice (affinity system)
- Time-lapse of ingredient gathering

GIFs get retweeted 3x more than static images.

### 5. The "Ask for Help" Post
Solo devs get huge community support when they're genuine:
- "Stuck on this design problem, what would you do?"
- "Should the demo be 30 min or 60 min?"
- "What's most important in a potion crafting system?"

People love feeling involved in creation.

## What NOT to Do (Common Mistakes)

### ❌ Waiting Until the Game is Done
Start marketing NOW. Build an audience WHILE building the game.

### ❌ Only Posting When You Want Something
Don't go silent for months, then post "BUY MY GAME!"

### ❌ Comparing Yourself to AAA Marketing
You're not Stardew Valley (yet). You're a solo dev. Lean into that.

### ❌ Trying to Be On Every Platform
Pick 2-3 max. Twitter + itch.io + Reddit is plenty.

### ❌ Paying for Followers/Engagement
Waste of money. 100 real fans > 10,000 fake followers.

### ❌ Ignoring Feedback
Your early followers are your focus group. Listen to them.

### ❌ Burning Out on Marketing
1-2 hrs/week max. Seriously. The game has to come first.

## Measuring Success (The Right Metrics)

**Forget these (vanity metrics):**
- Total followers
- Total likes
- Impressions

**Track these (actionable metrics):**
- Wishlist conversions (itch.io or Steam)
- Engaged followers (people who comment/reply regularly)
- Demo downloads
- Playtester feedback quality
- Email list signups (if you start one)

**Your Goal for Demo Launch:**
- 50-200 demo downloads
- 10-20 pieces of quality feedback
- 5-10 engaged community members
- 1-2 small streamers/YouTubers who cover it

This is PLENTY for a solo dev's first demo.

---

- **OBS Studio** - Record gameplay clips (free)
- **ShareX** - Screenshots and GIFs (free, Windows)
- **Krita or GIMP** - Image editing if needed (free)
- **Canva Free** - Social media graphics (free tier is fine)

### Distribution

- **Twitter/X** - Primary social (free)
- **Reddit** - Community engagement (free)
- **Discord** - Consider creating your own server later (free)

## The Long Game (Realistic Expectations)

### Month 1-3: Building Foundation
- 10-50 followers/community members
- Learning what resonates
- Establishing your voice
- Goal: People know you exist

### Month 4-6: Growing Slowly
- 50-200 followers/community members
- A few engaged fans who comment regularly
- Demo gets 50-200 downloads
- Goal: Validation that people care

### Month 7-12: Momentum
- 200-1000 followers/community members
- 20-50 wishlists (if on Steam)
- Small but loyal community
- Goal: Enough interest to justify continuing

### Year 2+: Sustainable Growth
- 1000-5000 followers/community members
- Real community forming around your game
- Streamers occasionally cover updates
- Goal: Launch with a built-in audience

**Remember:** Hollow Knight sold 2.8M copies. The dev had 0 followers when they started. They built the audience WHILE building the game over 4 years.

Patience wins.

## FAQ for Solo Devs Who Hate Marketing

**Q: I don't play games regularly. How can I market a game?**
A: You're making a game about potions, relationships, and life's journey. You don't need to be a gamer - you need to find people who love cozy experiences and meaningful choices. Focus on the themes (alchemy, growing up, choices matter) not on gamer culture.

**Q: I only have 10 hrs/week total. How can I spare time for marketing?**
A: Marketing is development. Finding players early = better feedback = better game. Spend 1 hr/week. That's 10% of your time. Worth it.

**Q: What if no one cares about my posts?**
A: They won't at first. Your first 10 posts might get 2 likes each. That's normal. Post #50 might get 200 likes because you've built trust and audience. Consistency compounds.

**Q: Should I wait until the demo is polished?**
A: No. Share the messy process. People love seeing games evolve. "Here's my ugly placeholder art" gets more engagement than "Here's my perfect screenshot" because it's relatable.

**Q: I'm scared of public failure.**
A: The only real failure is building a game in silence for 2 years and launching to crickets. Share early, fail small, adjust often.

**Q: Do I need to be on TikTok/Instagram/YouTube?**
A: Not if it stresses you out. Twitter + itch.io + Reddit is enough. Quality on 2 platforms > mediocrity on 6.

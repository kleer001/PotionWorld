**Key takeaway:** Marketing = showing up consistently and sharing your journey

### 2. MARKETING_CONTENT_EXAMPLES.md
**Purpose:** Specific content ideas with examples
**Read when:** Every 2-3 weeks for inspiration

**What's in it:**
- How to showcase ESENS notation (quizzes, combo threads, infographics)
- How to showcase life journey narrative (character evolution, timeline graphs)
- How to showcase cozy + meaningful choices (choice trees, philosophy posts)
- Content calendar (what to post each week)
- 15-minute content kit (when you're short on time)

**Key takeaway:** You have unique hooks. Here's how to show them off.

### 3. SOCIAL_MEDIA_TEMPLATES.md
**Purpose:** Copy-paste templates for when you don't know what to post
**Read when:** Every Monday when you need to post

**What's in it:**
- Twitter templates (progress updates, ESENS quizzes, design philosophy)

- itch.io devlog templates (monthly updates, system spotlights)
- Email template (reaching out to streamers)
- Emergency 10-minute post (when you're out of time)

## FAQ

**Q: Which document should I read first?**
A: Start with `MARKETING_PLAN.md` (read in 20 minutes). Then bookmark `SOCIAL_MEDIA_TEMPLATES.md` for weekly use.

**Q: Do I need to read all three documents?**
A: Not all at once! Read `MARKETING_PLAN.md` now. Use `SOCIAL_MEDIA_TEMPLATES.md` weekly. Reference `MARKETING_CONTENT_EXAMPLES.md` when you need inspiration.

**Q: I'm still overwhelmed. What's the ABSOLUTE minimum?**
A: Post once per week using any template from `SOCIAL_MEDIA_TEMPLATES.md`. That's it. That's enough.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: First 10 posts: crickets. Posts 11-30: a few likes. Posts 31-50: real engagement. Posts 50+: small community forming. This is normal. Keep going.

**Q: What if my posts get zero engagement?**
A: Totally normal for the first month. You're building trust and audience. Consistency compounds. Post #1 might get 2 likes. Post #50 might get 50. Stay the course.

**Q: Can I skip marketing and just make the game?**
A: You CAN, but then you'll launch to an empty room. Starting early means you have 100-1000 people waiting for your demo. Starting late means you launch and hope.

**Q: I hate social media. Do I really have to?**
A: You don't need to love it. You just need to show up. 1 hour/week. That's 10% of your dev time. Worth it for finding your audience.
